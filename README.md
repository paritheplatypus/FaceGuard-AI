# FaceGuard-AI: Detecting AI-Generated Faces using Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

## üìö Introduction
With the increasing usage of AI tools, distinguishing between real and AI-generated images has become crucial. Hyper-realistic human faces generated by models like **GANs** and **Stable Diffusion** pose serious risks in areas such as politics, social media, and digital forensics where misinformation and identity theft are major concerns.

This project aims to develop a machine learning system capable of identifying whether a given facial image is real or generated by AI using techniques like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.

## üì¶ Dataset
We are using the [140K Real and Fake Faces Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces/data) from Kaggle, which includes:
- **70,000 real faces** sourced from the [Flickr dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dullaz/flickrfaces-dataset-nvidia-128x128) collected by Nvidia.
- **70,000 fake faces** generated by [StyleGAN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dullaz/1m-ai-generated-faces-128x128).

Each image is in **RGB** format and has been resized to **128x128 pixels**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach
We followed a standard **supervised machine learning** pipeline with the following stages:
1. **Data Collection**: Download and organize the datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, augment images, and split into training/testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Build and train a CNN architecture for binary classification (real vs. AI-generated).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Test the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Visualization**: Generate confusion matrices, ROC curves, and sample predictions.
6. **Experimentation**: Explore alternative models or architectures for improved performance.
